"""
Given a table customer holding customers information and the referee.

+------+------+-----------+
| id   | name | referee_id|
+------+------+-----------+
|    1 | Will |      NULL |
|    2 | Jane |      NULL |
|    3 | Alex |         2 |
|    4 | Bill |      NULL |
|    5 | Zack |         1 |
|    6 | Mark |         2 |
+------+------+-----------+
Write a query to return the list of customers NOT referred by the person with id '2'.

For the sample data above, the result is:

+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+


Solution:
where referee_id != 2 is not enough, because NULL compared to 2 is UNKNOWN

MySQL uses three-valued logic -- TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. Anything compared to NULL evaluates to the third value: UNKNOWN. That “anything” includes NULL itself! That’s why MySQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to specifically check for NULL.

Thus, one more condition 'referee_id IS NULL' should be added to the WHERE clause as below.
